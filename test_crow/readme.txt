Crows, static and jointed/animated.

Credits: Crow model and texture by TDash. Rigged and scripted by vfig.

Use the 'DCrowJ' model with the 'CrowJointsRandom' script to make a crow who keeps changing pose every few seconds. Use Script>Timing to change the median time between poses (+/- 50%). You can send TurnOff/TurnOn to disable/re-enable the pose animating.

The 'CrowJointsTest' script is primarily meant for debugging. You can use it like in the test mission setup to select specific poses if you want; but probably if you want specific poses, a different script would suit better.

Test mission is for Thief II, NewDark 1.27 or newer.
