Caustics on terrain.

Uses material files to blend an animated texture (plain white, with caustics in the alpha channel) with a brick texture.

The /tex/fx/caust_*.png textures have the bare caustics, while /tex/fx/causx_*.png fade out vertically (so you can make the caustics fade away).

The file /caust_.psd is where the generated caustics images were tweaked for contrast, and (for caustx) the fade added; it does not need to be distributed with a mission.

The file /caust.cst is the settings used for Caustics Generator; it does not need to be distributed with a mission.

The original caustics images were generated with Caustics Generator v1.3 by Kjell Andersson and Mathias Bergvall, which for convenience is included here in a zip.
