Motion tag test map, by vfig.

Focuses on human, "Conv" tags. Additional motions are from Shadowspawn's GMDB.

Browse the shop, grab a container, frob the items it gives you.

Containers and items are all driven from scripts. If you want to customise them, you can add more things to the table in motions.nut; and you can clone the spawners (StockMotions, GMDBMotions) and edit their Design Note to select which group they spawn containers for.
