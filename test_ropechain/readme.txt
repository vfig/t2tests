Simple chain, for use as climbable ropes. Version 1.
Created by vfig, based on jochain1 by Jason Otto.


OVERVIEW:

There are three sets of chain models, each in four lengths. Each set is for
a different size of chain link. You should choose the size based on how
chonky you want your chain to feel, and select the model length that is the
closest to the length of your rope, so the links will be minimally stretched.

FILES TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MISSION:

For the models you have used, you will need the .bin and the matching .cal file
from the mesh/ folder.

All of the models use the same texture: you will need ropechns.tga and
ropechns.mtl from the mesh/txt16/ folder.


SAMPLE MISSION:

test_ropechns.mis demonstrates all three sizes of chain in all three lengths.
You should NOT distribute this file with your mission.


SOURCE FILES:

The Blender source files for these models are in the meshrc/ folder. You should
NOT distribute these with your mission.
