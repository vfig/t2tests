various experiments with the dark engine.

most of these are things i am planning to use in my own fan missions. please do not adopt them into your own fan missions without talking to me first and getting my permission. for one thing, it would be rude; for another, they would probably work better if adapted to your needs, and i would most likely be interested in helping you with that adaption for a better result.

regardless of the above, if, at the time of reading, it has been five years or more since the last commit to this repository, then you may use anything and everything within it under the terms of the WTFPL.
