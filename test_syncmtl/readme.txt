concept: a large object (or collection of objects) that does door-property vertical movement under control of an external switch. because the object is very large, it will look bad if normal object lighting is used.

epic hack: build the map with raycast lighting. extract the object mesh **and lightmap texture** from the .mis. bake that lightmap texture into a texture with the same uvs as the base model. make the in-game object fullbright. use .mtl rendering to have an alternate texture that is a second pass blending in the lightmap texture. use uv_mod to scroll this second pass at the same rate as the door moves (ensure the door cannot be blocked!!). and time the door opening at an appropriate interval of sim time. result: the render pass texture appears to be in worldspace! (ideally this moving object is visual only, detailattached to the door, and any actual collisions are from the door object itself, and any doubles slaved to it)

this demo doesnt do the lightmap extraction, but simply demonstrates keeping the render pass texture in sync with the door movement. there is a slight phase error (look at the top of the door as it hits the top, you will see a bit of blue for one frame); maybe it can be tweaked away, but also it is not very noticeable.
